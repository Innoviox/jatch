Schedule (Prelim):

 1. Find out how to download, extract, and parse scratch files.
    - Parse JSON => usable maps
 2. Make a Sprite interface, and write code that implements it
    - Like incrementally build a string (example):
    ```
       public class Sprite1 extends Sprite {
           %s
       }
    ```
    - add in methods with String.format?
 3. Decide graphics library
